            I am a frontend enthusiast with a focus on artistic side.
             I like when web pages look awesome and have that <span class="fancy-underline">wow</span> effect.
             My coding career did not start a long time ago, but in that small time window I got <span class="fancy-underline">a lot</span>
             of amazing opportunities and a chance to meet awesome people in tech. That only gave me more reasons to pursue the
             career in this field.
